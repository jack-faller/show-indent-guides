* What Is It?
This package provides =show-indent-guides-mode= which will render vertical bars at each level of indent. In addition to languages with a fixed indent offset such as C, it can be used in languages with arbitrary offsets such as Lisp. To avoid input lag, a longer idle delay is used in evil insert mode so that guides are not unnecessarily redrawn when characters are inserted on the end of a line. (Those not using Evil may wish to increase the value of =shig-idle-time= if they experience input lag.)
* How to Activate?
To render indent guides in code files:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'show-indent-guides-mode)
#+end_src
